# Morse To LED
Encode a string to morse code and see an LED blink

### Usage

Put your LED light path in BRIGHTNESS_PATH variable, it's most likely in `/sys/class/leds` directory

Then run `sudo python3 main.py` (requires root to work)

### Note

Tested only on Lenovo laptop! It actually may damage your hardware, I'm not responsible lmao
